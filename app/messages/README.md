# Messaging Routes

This directory contains the Next.js App Router implementation for the `/messages` route.

## Route Migration Notes

The messaging pages have been converted from using React Router to Next.js routing:

1. React Router imports and functions have been commented out
2. Next.js `useRouter` and `useSearchParams` hooks are now used
3. Navigation functions have been updated to use Next.js routing
4. Query parameters are now accessed via Next.js's `useSearchParams()`

## Changes Made

- Kept all original functionality but adapted to Next.js routing patterns
- Added proper error handling for chat state
- All components are now wrapped in Suspense for better loading experience
- No code was removed, only commented out as requested

## How to Use

- Access the original messaging page at `/messages`
- Access the new messaging page at `/messages-new`
- Both pages now use Next.js routing under the hood

## Structure

- `page.tsx`: The main entry point for the route that loads the legacy messaging page component from `/pages/messaging-page/index.tsx`

## Notes

- The component is wrapped in a dynamic import and Suspense to ensure proper loading and hydration
- SSR is disabled for this component to avoid hydration issues
- No code was removed from the original implementation
